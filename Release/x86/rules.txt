When starting a game, the computer will
randomly generate 4 different colored
chips.

Your objective will be to guess the
chips in the correct order in 12 tries
or less.

Chips colors are:
A for Aqua
B for Blue
F for Fuschia
R for Red
Y for Yellow
L for Lime

The computer will compare your guesses
to their solution and output pegs
depending on how close you are.
Pegs will deliberately not let you know
exactly which chip is correct,
just that your guess contains a correct
chip.

Pegs and their meaning:
White if a chip is the right color but
wrong location
Red if a chip is the right color and
location
Pegs display sample:

NOTE: If you input more than 4
characters the computer will only take
the first 4, and if you input less than
4 characters the computer will fill in
the missing characters with X.
